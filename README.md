# Data Cleaning & Analysis Project

This project focuses on **cleaning and preparing transaction data** for analysis. It handles missing values, duplicates, format issues, text standardization, and outliers to ensure high-quality, reliable data for insights and decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset includes transaction details such as:
- Transaction ID
- Item
- Quantity
- Price Per Unit
- Total Spent
- Payment Method
- Location
- Transaction Date

## Data Cleaning Steps
- **Missing Values:** Identified and handled using mean/median or removal
- **Duplicates:** Duplicate records removed
- **Data Formats:** Corrected inconsistent date and numeric formats
- **Standardizing Text:** Unified item names and text fields
- **Outliers:** Detected and treated outliers for reliable analysis

## How to Run
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
- Ensure required libraries are installed: `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.
- Run cells/scripts sequentially to reproduce cleaning steps
